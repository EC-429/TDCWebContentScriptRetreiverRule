This script has been created for Retrieving web contents utilizing the LUA programming language. It is to be used within the Tripwire Data Collector 'Web Content Script Retreiver Rule' and run through a Tripwire Data Collector node.

The script makes a request to the end device, stores the html content body, searches for regex patterns with the body content, and lastly presents the results.
